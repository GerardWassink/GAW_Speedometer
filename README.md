# GAW_Speedometer
This project is built to be able to measure model train speeds. The core is an Arduino nano. The output is going to an LCD 20x4 display. Two infrared sensors are used to pick up trains rolling by and measuring the milliseconds it takes from one to the other sensor. It works bi-directional.

In model railroading the scale of course is important for the speed calculation. The default scale is N-scale which is 1:160. This default scale can be altered for 7 other scales.
